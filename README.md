# sound <-> data

This repo has scripts I've been using to turn data into sounds and
sounds into data.

[Table of note frequencies on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_pitch_notation#Table_of_note_frequencies)

## Solar-like oscillations

Try sampling lightcurves at 30s to write sound files at 44100 Hz.
That multiplies frequencies by 30*44.1e3 = 1.323e6.  The Sun's peak
frequency of 3090 uHz is shifted to 4088.7 Hz, which is very but not
excrutiatingly high pitched (somewhere between B7/C8).
